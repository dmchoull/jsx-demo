# JSX Demo

Demo of JSX transformation via babel and some simple functions to render it into a webpage without any other libraries.

## Setup

`npm install`

## Build

`npm run build`

Build output will be `dist/index.js`

## Start server

`npm start`

This starts a web server at http://localhost:5000 serving `index.html` which loads the `dist/index.js` script.
